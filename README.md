# UnamWebPanel v1.7.1

A web panel currently used to optionally monitor and manage the [SilentCryptoMiner](https://github.com/UnamSanctam/SilentCryptoMiner). Might support any other projects I release in the future as well.

## Setup

The panel is quite easy to set up, the only real requirement is a  web server with PHP support. You can either host it yourself using Apache or something similar, or you can use any free or paid online webhost. Nearly all webhosts has PHP support so it should not be difficult to find one you can use.

Here are some simple steps to get started:
1. Download the panel files and open the UnamWebPane\config.php file with a text editor.
2. Change the `$config['password'] = 'UnamSanctam';` (change `UnamSanctam` to your own password) to whatever password you wish to use, this is the password used to access the web panel.
3. Upload the contents of the UnamWebPanel folder to your webhosts "public_html" folder or the respective folder for your specific webhost.
4. Your web panel should now be up and running, you can browse to the URL or IP of your website and you should see the login screen if everything went correctly.

If you wish to add the web panel to the SilentCryptoMiner then enter the following website URL: `http://yourwebsite.com/api/endpoint.php` (replace yourwebsite.com with your URL or IP, also make sure to use the correct `http` or `https` protocol depending on if your site has SSL "support" or not) into the `API Endpoint URL` field inside the miner.das

If you use something other than Apache or IIS to host the web panel then you should check if your database file is exposed to the internet, you can check it by visting the URL `http://yourwebsite.com/unamwebpanel.db` (replace yourwebsite.com with your URL or IP), if it says forbidden or doesn't display anything then your database is secured.

### For local testing

If you simply want to set up a local web panel for testing then here are some simple steps to do so.
1. Download XAMPP and install it
2. Extract the UnamWebPanel files into `C:\xampp\htdocs` (or wherever you installed it)
3. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and press the "Start" button next to "Apache"
4. Browse to http://localhost/ and you should be able to login (default password `UnamSanctam`) and view the web panel

Then if you want any local miners on your computer to connect to it then enter http://localhost/api/endpoint.php into the "API Endpoint URL" of the miners in the miner builder.
